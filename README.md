# Refactor
## 1st week challenge - Maria Andrea Rodriguez

### Description

For the first week challenge, we refractor a given html and css file in order to simplify, order and correct code for better reading and performing, as well as, to help the website given be more accessible.

For that, I proceeded to investigate the code writen and compare it to the css file and with that I corrected the following:

HTML

1. Gave the Website the proper name.
2. Added the _header_ tag.
3. Added the _navigation_ tag to the body.
4. Separated the "sections" with the _article_ tag instead of the _div_ tag, added _alt text_ to the images, and shortened the _class_ names.
5. Added the _footer_ tag and deleted the _div_ tag with the _class=footer_. This gave the html file a proper structure aa the _div_ was unnecesary code.

CSS

1. Ordered the _header_, _classes_ and _footer_ in chronological order for easy reading.
2. Corrected the names of the _classes_ that were edited in the html file.
3. This part was tricky as I found out that for everychange you make to the html, a change immediately need to proceed in the css file to keep order.

I found that correcting the CSS was more challenging than the html. Specially when I proceeded to give one _class_ name a duplicated name and the entire header had a blue border. It's finding that specific dot(.) and mistake to correct  that is quite draining. Patience is key!

Throughout the process I placed comments of the changes made for easy understanding.

Please see the link to my repository next. I'll await for your comments.
